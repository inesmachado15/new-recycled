description: "UI/UX design rules for web interfaces: accessibility, touch and interaction, performance, style consistency, responsive layout, typography and color, animation, forms, navigation and charts. Use when designing, building, reviewing or fixing pages and components (store pages, product pages, checkout, forms, admin screens), or when choosing color, typography, spacing or layout."

# UI/UX Pro Max - Design Rules

> Text-only copy of [nextlevelbuilder/ui-ux-pro-max-skill](https://github.com/nextlevelbuilder/ui-ux-pro-max-skill) (MIT, commit 7246805). The upstream Python search tool and CSV database are intentionally not included; use the rule files in `references/` instead.

## When to Apply

Use this Skill when the task involves **UI structure, visual design decisions, interaction patterns, or user experience quality control**: designing new pages, creating/refactoring UI components, choosing color/typography/spacing/layout systems, reviewing UI for UX/accessibility/consistency, implementing navigation/animation/responsive behavior, or improving perceived quality and usability.

Skip it for pure backend logic, API/database design, non-visual performance work, infrastructure/DevOps, or non-visual scripts — unless the task changes how something **looks, feels, moves, or is interacted with**.

## Rule Categories by Priority

*Follow priority 1→10 to decide which category to focus on first. The full rule text for every category lives in `references/quick-reference.md` — read it on demand rather than loading it every time.*

| Priority | Category | Impact | Domain | Key Checks (Must Have) | Anti-Patterns (Avoid) |
|----------|----------|--------|--------|------------------------|------------------------|
| 1 | Accessibility | CRITICAL | `ux` | Contrast 4.5:1, Alt text, Keyboard nav, Aria-labels | Removing focus rings, Icon-only buttons without labels |
| 2 | Touch & Interaction | CRITICAL | `ux` | Min size 44×44px, 8px+ spacing, Loading feedback | Reliance on hover only, Instant state changes (0ms) |
| 3 | Performance | HIGH | `ux` | WebP/AVIF, Lazy loading, Reserve space (CLS &lt; 0.1) | Layout thrashing, Cumulative Layout Shift |
| 4 | Style Selection | HIGH | `style`, `product` | Match product type, Consistency, SVG icons (no emoji) | Mixing flat & skeuomorphic randomly, Emoji as icons |
| 5 | Layout & Responsive | HIGH | `ux` | Mobile-first breakpoints, Viewport meta, No horizontal scroll | Horizontal scroll, Fixed px container widths, Disable zoom |
| 6 | Typography & Color | MEDIUM | `typography`, `color` | Base 16px, Line-height 1.5, Semantic color tokens | Text &lt; 12px body, Gray-on-gray, Raw hex in components |
| 7 | Animation | MEDIUM | `ux`, `gsap` | Context-aware timing, Motion conveys meaning, Spatial continuity | One duration for every transition, Animating width/height, No reduced-motion |
| 8 | Forms & Feedback | MEDIUM | `ux` | Visible labels, Error near field, Helper text, Progressive disclosure | Placeholder-only label, Errors only at top, Overwhelm upfront |
| 9 | Navigation Patterns | HIGH | `ux` | Predictable back, Bottom nav ≤5, Deep linking | Overloaded nav, Broken back behavior, No deep links |
| 10 | Charts & Data | LOW | `chart` | Legends, Tooltips, Accessible colors | Relying on color alone to convey meaning |

For the full rule list per category (all 119 UX guidelines with rationale), read `references/quick-reference.md`. For app-specific polish rules (icons, touch feedback, dark mode contrast, safe areas) and the canonical pre-delivery checklist, read `references/pro-rules.md`.

## Where to look

| Problem | What to Do |
|---------|------------|
| Dark mode contrast issues | `references/quick-reference.md` §6: `color-dark-mode` + `color-accessible-pairs` |
| Animations feel unnatural | `references/quick-reference.md` §7: `spring-physics` + `easing` + `exit-faster-than-enter` |
| Form UX is poor | `references/quick-reference.md` §8: `inline-validation` + `error-clarity` + `focus-management` |
| Navigation feels confusing | `references/quick-reference.md` §9: `nav-hierarchy` + `bottom-nav-limit` + `back-behavior` |
| Layout breaks on small screens | `references/quick-reference.md` §5: `mobile-first` + `breakpoint-consistency` |
| Performance / jank | `references/quick-reference.md` §3: `virtualize-lists` + `main-thread-budget` + `debounce-throttle` |

## Before delivering UI

Run through the relevant categories in `references/quick-reference.md` (accessibility, touch targets, responsive layout and forms at minimum). `references/pro-rules.md` holds a pre-delivery checklist written for native/mobile app UI; apply the parts that carry over to the web (icons, interaction feedback, contrast, safe areas).
